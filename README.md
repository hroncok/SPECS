Legal problems
--------------

### perl-Math-Geometry-Voronoi

**Problem:** The perl module is OK, but the C code in it is unlicensed, author is asked.

**TODO:** Wait for 1st author of the C code and see, if he agrees. Ask second author.

**Involved packages:** _self_, slic3r

### perl-Math-Libm

**Problem:** The perl module is unlicensed, but it is autogenerated from LGPL code from glibc using h2xs. The author is dead or similar.

**Didn't work:** I've tried to repeat author's steps, but it doesn't work. I even tried to use glibc from 2000. I might also try h2xs from 2000 (already downloaded Red Hat Linux 7), but it seems there are some modifications of the code made by the dead author.

**TODO:** Shoot myself to the head.

**Involved packages:** _self_, perl-Math-NumSeq, perl-Math-PlanePath, sli3r
