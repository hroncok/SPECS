%description
Mpv is a movie player that plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, OGG/OGM,
VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM,
RoQ, and PVA files. You can also use it to watch VCDs, SVCDs, DVDs,
3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies.
It supports a wide range of output drivers including X11, XVideo, DGA,
OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB etc. There are also nice
antialiased shaded subtitles and OSD.
It is a fork of mplayer and mplayer2.
